# mycelium-colonization-factorial-experiment

The following experiment has been conducted to see what factors affect the time for mycelium to fully colonize the substrate itâ€™s growing in. The model to assess the factors that affect colonization times is a 2^3 factorial design, where three factors, having two levels each, have been evaluated with n = 3 experimental units at each factor-level combination. The factors of interest are incubation temperature (room temperature vs 80F), vermiculite type (fine vs coarse), and water content (2:1:1.9 vs 2:1:2.1 ratios of brown rice flour, vermiculite, and water, respectively).
